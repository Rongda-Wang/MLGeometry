# MLGeometry

Higher dimensional computational geometry using machine learning software 

- Kahler geometry and Kahler-Einstein metrics

More to come.

## Requirements

numpy >= 1.18.5 \
sympy >= 1.6.1   \
tensorflow >= 2.3.0

An older version may cause unexpected bugs.

tensorflow\_probablity is also required for the L-BFGS optimizer.
