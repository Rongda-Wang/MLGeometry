# Leaderboard

Here we give both leaderboard and a link to a script which does the following:
Run 5 or so example CYs and apply the following criteria:
1. No more than 2 hours runtime per example (we will run them on our cluster).
2. All examples should meet some minimal accuracy (e.g. 0.1% MAPE)
3. Rank the qualifying entries by accuracy (averaged error over all examples).
